In the era where order food to calling a friend who on the otherside of the world is just a button way, technology is at its peak. I believe it is making the world smaller, better and faster. Technology like Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is growing a rapid phase but it seems that there is more than 80% unexplored data which can be utilized for the benefits of mankind.  This project is focused on using Machine Learning techniques to extract the information from a dataset. I have used standard Machine Learning techniques to analyze the performance of the several algorithms on this learning task. In addition, I have made use of several libraries like seaborn, scikit learn, pandans etc to understand and visualize my analysis. The dataset used here for analysis contains 40 major food nutrients like calories, fat, vitamins, minerals etc. And it also contains 25 different categories of food products like Beef Products, Vegetable Products, Baked Products etc. Various analysis tools and techniques have used like splitting the dataset, correlation matrixs to understand the dependency of each category of items, Normalization to improve my results, Support Vector Machines and finally prediction to check my learnings.  My analysis is approximately 52% accurate. This can be further improved if we are considering other aspects of nutrient chart. This model can be used to predict which type of FoodGroup you are looking at given the nutrient values.
